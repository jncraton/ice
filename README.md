Project Ice or the Integrated coding experience is a new way to teach and practice programing in the classroom. The goals of project Ice are as follows:
1. Provide a tool for instructors to present, demonstrate, and build interactive activity to enhance their students learning
2. Provide a way for students to practice their programing skills through instructor made activities or in a sandbox environment
3. Allow for a more integrated way to demonstrate programing skills
